# Problem
Create a program that computes the scrabble score of a word based on given values for letters.

# Solution
create a hash that has number values as keys and arrays of letters as values. Iterate through the characters of the `word`, find the character's value by matching it with the collection of letters in the hash, add the key to the result, and keep going.
